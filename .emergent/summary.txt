<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully executed a two-phase development process. Initially, the core task was to resolve a  error during the Next.js static build process of an LTI Roleplay Bot. This was achieved by refactoring  to use direct SQLite database access for scenario fetching, eliminating dependency on a running server during build time. After resolving this, the user expanded the scope, requesting a robust working application with full Gemini AI integration, comprehensive admin CRUD for scenarios, users, analytics, and reports, plus a test/demo mode. The AI engineer implemented these features, creating and modifying several Next.js pages and utility files (e.g., , , ). The development included dependency installation and troubleshooting a port conflict. The application is now declared fully functional, having addressed all specified requirements.

<product_requirements>
The initial problem focused on fixing  errors during the  process of an LTI-integrated Gemini Roleplay Bot. This Next.js application, using SQLite, failed to generate static pages because it attempted to fetch scenarios from  when no server was running. The core requirement was to make the build process succeed and the application runnable.

After this initial fix, the user explicitly requested a comprehensive, robust application. The expanded requirements included:
1.  **Gemini AI Integration**: Implement actual Gemini AI using a GOOGLE API key.
2.  **Full Admin CRUD**: Develop complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for:
    *   Scenarios (management and creation).
    *   Users.
    *   Analytics.
    *   Reports.
3.  **Test/Demo Mode**: Create a mode to allow development and testing without requiring actual LTI launches.

The previous engineer addressed these, implementing direct database access for scenarios, integrating Gemini AI, and building out the requested admin functionalities, culminating in a fully functional application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had successfully completed all user-defined tasks for the LTI Gemini Roleplay Bot application. The application is now in a fully functional and production-ready state.

The key work accomplished includes:
1.  **Resolved Build Issues**: The initial  error during  was fixed by refactoring  to perform direct database access (SQLite) for scenarios, eliminating the need for a running server during static page generation. This ensures the application builds reliably.
2.  **Gemini AI Integration**: Real Gemini AI integration was implemented via modifications to  and , allowing for AI-driven roleplay functionality. The integration leverages a GOOGLE API key for this purpose.
3.  **Comprehensive Admin CRUD**: Full administrative capabilities were added. New or modified pages like , , , and  provide interfaces for managing scenarios, users, analytics, and training sessions respectively. The main admin dashboard () was updated to reflect these capabilities.
4.  **Scenario Selection**: The  was updated to correctly display available training scenarios and enable user interaction.
5.  **Robustness and Testing**: The application dependencies were installed, and issues like an  port conflict during server restart were resolved. The AI engineer performed multiple rounds of testing, confirming that the build process, homepage, , , and  endpoints are all working as expected.

The application now features a robust backend for data management, an integrated AI engine, and a functional Next.js frontend, ready for educational use.
